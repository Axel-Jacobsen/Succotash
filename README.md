# SUCCOTASH

The goal of this is to implement basic neural network architectures with a focus on...
  1. the math behind machine learning
  2. fast training on a CPU

#### File Structure
```
nn.py          -> the neural network
train.py       -> a file to train and test the network
test.py        -> small basic tests that the network functions as expected
activations.py -> nonlinear activation functions
loss_fcns.py   -> Loss/Error/Cost functions
```

#### TODO:
- Implement basic classification
- Implement LSTM
